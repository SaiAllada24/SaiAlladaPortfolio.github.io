                🛠 Approach & Frameworks: Design Thinking, Stakeholder Mapping, Persona Development,

            </p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
                This initiative examined child labor not as an isolated social issue, but as a complex systems challenge
                shaped by economic pressure, education gaps, policy limitations, and community dynamics.
                Leading a six-member interdisciplinary team, the project applied the full Design Thinking framework
                to uncover root causes, align stakeholders, and design structured intervention pathways.
                The objective was to create a scalable, community-supported Child Safety & Education Continuity model
                that balances analytical rigor with human-centered insight.
            </p>

            <h3>Problem Framing</h3>
            <p>
                Traditional approaches to child labor often focus on enforcement or short-term rescue interventions,
                without addressing systemic drivers such as household income dependency, school accessibility,
                or community-level support structures.
                The challenge was to redefine the problem in a way that integrates social realities,
                policy constraints, and practical implementation considerations into a cohesive strategy.
            </p>

            <h3>Approach & Methodology</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Conducted stakeholder mapping to identify affected groups including children, families, local educators, and policymakers.</li>
                        <li>Developed detailed personas to capture lived experiences, behavioral motivations, and structural constraints.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Designed a Child Safety & Education Continuity System integrating community oversight,
                            education retention mechanisms, and structured monitoring processes.</li>
                        <li>Evaluated solution feasibility across scalability, stakeholder alignment, and long-term sustainability dimensions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <span class="highlight">Prototype & Validation:</span>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Developed conceptual frameworks and process flows illustrating implementation pathways.</li>
                        <li>Tested assumptions through feedback loops and iterative refinement discussions within the team.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h3>Key Outcomes & Strategic Insights</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reframed child labor as a systems-level issue requiring coordinated intervention rather than isolated enforcement.</li>
                <li>Demonstrated how structured analytical reasoning enhances human-centered solution design.</li>
                <li>Proposed a scalable intervention framework balancing empathy, policy alignment, and operational practicality.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Leadership & Professional Impact</h3>
            <ul>
