                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    This project focuses on enhancing driving safety by developing a system that evaluates driver alertness through the analysis of EEG signals. The key component of the solution is a multi-head attention-based transformer model that classifies response times into distinct vigilance levels, offering a data-driven approach to assess driver performance in real-time.
